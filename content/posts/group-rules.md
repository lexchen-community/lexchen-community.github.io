**Hello! Welcome to our IT community LexChen!**

Before chatting, you need to familiarize yourself with these rules:

1. Respect other members of the community. Do not insult, troll or threaten other members.

2. Don't use the community to spread viruses or malware.

3. Do not post illegal content, including pirated software or other copyright infringement (Hackintosh is an exception).

4. Do not post links to sites with unreliable content or fraudulent schemes.

5. Do not use the community to advertise goods or services without prior approval from the moderators.

6. Try to stay on topic. Do not post messages that are not related to the topic of IT.

7. Do not post personal information of other members without their permission.

8. Remember that moderators have the right to delete posts that violate the community rules and block members who do not follow the rules.
